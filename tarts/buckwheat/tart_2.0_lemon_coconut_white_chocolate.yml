        the doe is very crumbly 
        it is very dry and sandy, and the buckwheat leaves miniature grains

        strong buckwheat taste with notes of cinnamon
  - creme:
    - texture:
        the whole buckwheat grains are prominent with creme inbetween

        very lemony and buckwheat

projection:
  - moisture:
      the buckwheat absorbs a lot of th water content
      should add moisture (especially in the crust)
  - elasticity:
      should add some binding agent (gluten, egg) or alike into crust
  - creme:
      the whole buckweat texture is disturbing to some people
      should try brown buckwheat for the creme next time
      can add more fat (milk butter)
