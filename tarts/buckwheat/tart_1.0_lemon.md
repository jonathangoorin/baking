3. Tasting:
    - Crust:
      - texture: 
          the doe is very crumbly 
          it is very dry and sandy, and the buckwheat leaves miniature grains
      - taste:
          strong buckwheat taste with notes of cinnamon
    - Creme:
      - texture:
          the whole buckwheat grains are prominent with creme inbetween
      - taste:
          very lemony and buckwheat

4. Projection:
    - Moisture:
        the buckwheat absorbs a lot of th water content
        should add moisture (especially in the crust)
    - Elasticity:
        should add some binding agent (gluten, egg) or alike into crust
    - Creme:
        the whole buckweat texture is disturbing to some people
        should try brown buckwheat for the creme next time
        can add more fat (milk butter)
